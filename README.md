Using 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥'𝐬 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲, generated a two sheet interactive excel pivot table report:-

1. 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐝:- This distribution of data has been represented by color bars in 'sum of value' column.
Choosing the filter options returns a set of values in the descending order representing the state/ut wise distribution of educated/illiterate prisoners.

2. 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:- This represents the domicile distribution of prisoners across India i.e (whether prisoners are domiciled in the same state where they have been arrested or prisoners belong to different state or prisoners are from different countries).

3 color-scaling has been used to display the intensity of values in the three columns (larger numbers are shaded in darker colors, smaller numbers are shaded in light colors).

User can filter through states/ut's on the right hand side which will return number for three categories for a particular state/ut or multiple state/ut's

Furthermore, percent distribution of all three categories has been shown on the right hand side and there's a dynamic pie chart that updates based upon the filter selection.
